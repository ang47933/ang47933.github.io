<h1> The University of Georgia</h1>
<p>The University of Georgia currently has more than <b>36,000</b> students enrolled. It is not just a place, it is our <big>home</big>. For some of us, it is more than just a place for us to learn. We get to engage in a wide array of activities as students here at UGA. We get to volunteer with programs like Extra Special People, my favorite volunteer opportunity thus far. We have the luxury to attend football games in Sanford Stadium with 93 thousand cheering fans. For me, UGA football games are my favorite thing we get to do as students.</p>

<h2 style="color:white;"> The History</h2>
<p> The University of Georgia football team played their first game in Athens, Georgia against Mercer University on January 25, 1892. Back then, the teams played on Herty Field. In that first season the South's Oldest Rivalry- Georgia v. Auburn began. Now, the Georgia Bulldogs play in the beloved Sanford Stadium. In this period from the beginning of UGA footbal to now, five Georgia Bulldogs teams have won National Championships. This includes the 1927 season where the team lost to Georgia Tech in Athens. Still, they were voted National Champions.  </p>

<h3 style="color:white;"> Coaches</h3>
<p> The Georgia Bulldogs have collectively had 26 head football coaches. The first being Coach Charles Herty, to our current Head Coach Kirby Smart. Legendary Coach Vince Dooley served as head coach from 1964-1988. During his tenure, his teams played 288 games. Of these 288 games, 201 were won by the Bulldogs. Mark Richt was the University of Georgia head coach from 2001-2015. Many students currently at UGA grew up watching Mark Richt coach. There were many mixed emotions when Coach Richt was fired following a win over rival Georgia Tech in Atlanta. During his last season the Dawgs went 9-3 in the record season.</p>

<h4 style="color:white;"> The 2017 Dawgs </h4>
<p> The 2017 Georgia Bulldogs team has started with a record of 9-1 with wins over Notre Dame, Florida and South Carolina. The one loss Georgia  Bulldogs fell to Number Ten Auburn 40-17. Following the loss to Auburn, UGA fell in the College Football Playoff rankings from Number One to Number Seven. The Bulldogs will face The Alabama Crimson Tide, or the Auburn Tigers for a second time in the SEC Championship in Atlanta, Georgia on December 2, 2017.</p>
